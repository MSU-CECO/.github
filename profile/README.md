The **[Computational Ecohydrology Group](https://www.egr.msu.edu/ceco/)** was created and is currently supervised by Michigan State University Research Foundation Professor [Dr. A.Pouyan Nejadhashemi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=e_8Bz-QAAAAJ). 
The Group develops and explores solutions to diverse topics, including data visualization and social and environmental modeling. 
The Group is comprised of three labs, each having a unique field of focus for which solutions to socio-environmental issues are developed and evaluated:
 * (A) The Decision Support and Informatics (DSI) Lab
   * [DSI Home page](https://dsiweb.cse.msu.edu/)
   * [DSI GitLab Page](https://gitlab.msu.edu/dsi-lab)
 * (B) The Environmental Modeling (EM) Lab, and
 * (C) The Sustainable Ecosystem Modeling (SEM) Lab.
